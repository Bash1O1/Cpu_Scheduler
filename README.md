Cpu Scheduler

Cpu scheduling is a process by which the processor is allocated to diffirent process for efficient execution. Cpu scheduling process executes process on the basis of multiple algorithms which are:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

First Come First Served (FCFS) is a scheduling algorithm in which the process that arrives first is executed first. It is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm, but it can lead to poor performance if there are processes with long burst times. This algorithm is a non-preemptive algorithm. In FCFS scheduling, the process that arrives first is executed first, regardless of its burst time or priority. This can lead to poor performance, as longer running processes will block shorter ones from being executed. It is commonly used in batch systems where the order of the processes is important.
